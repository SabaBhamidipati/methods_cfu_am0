# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I think on a 5 scale I'm at 3.5 because I often get confused between how methods work with hashes and classes. I also
have some confusion how methods work when they're being created and called on their own (if that's the right way of
thinking about it)

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I think I can write simple methods myself. Feeling 4/5 about that

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
I think I have the same question as above: how to keep them straight between writing simple ones by themselves,
when they're related to hashes, and when they work with classes.
